# OAuth 2.0 vs API Keys

# API Keys: Simple but limited

# Good for: Internal services, simple APIs
# Issues: No expiration, security concerns


# OAuth 2.0: Industry standard for secure authorization

# Client Credentials Flow: Application-to-application (what we'll use)
# Temporary tokens with expiration
# More secure than API keys
